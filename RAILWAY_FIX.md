# ðŸš¨ Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## The Problem
Railway can't find your `src/bot.js` file, which means the project structure wasn't uploaded correctly to GitHub.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Your GitHub Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telegram-study-bot`
2. **Verify you see these folders/files**:
   ```
   src/
   â”œâ”€â”€ bot.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
   â””â”€â”€ utils/
   package.json
   railway.toml
   Dockerfile
   ```

### 2. If Files Are Missing - Re-upload Everything

**Option A: Upload via GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. **Drag ALL project files** (including the `src` folder)
4. Commit changes

**Option B: Use Git Commands**
```bash
# In your project folder
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add all project files"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy Now" or wait for auto-deploy

### 4. Check Railway Logs
1. In Railway, go to "Deployments"
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check logs for:
   ```
   âœ… Database initialized
   âœ… Bot started successfully!
   ```

## Alternative: Manual File Check

If you're still having issues, create a simple test to verify your files:

1. **In Railway Variables**, add:
   ```
   DEBUG = true
   ```

2. **Check the deployment logs** - they should show file structure

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong File Structure
**Problem**: Files uploaded to root instead of maintaining folder structure
**Solution**: Re-upload maintaining the `src/` folder structure

### Issue 2: Missing package.json
**Problem**: Railway can't identify it as a Node.js project
**Solution**: Ensure `package.json` is in the root directory

### Issue 3: Git Ignore Issues
**Problem**: Important files were ignored during upload
**Solution**: Check `.gitignore` and ensure source files aren't ignored

## Verification Checklist âœ…

Before redeploying, ensure:
- [ ] `src/bot.js` exists in GitHub repo
- [ ] `package.json` exists in root
- [ ] All environment variables are set in Railway
- [ ] Railway shows "Node.js" as detected framework
